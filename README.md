# DiscordTokenJoiner
Original Code was from: https://github.com/DeadBread76/Discord-server-joiner/blob/master/joiner.py but I threw a bit of a twist on it so the tokens don't get banned right away. Make sure you install all prerequisite's before trying to use it. 

1. Place tokens in tokens.txt
2. Place your discord webhook in webhook.txt (optional) it's recommended to get notified for when its done
3. Run the discord_joiner.py
4. Input the stuff on screen
5. Wait and boom! You have now joined with shitty accounts
